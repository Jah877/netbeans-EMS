# netbeans-EMS
Developed an employee management system in NetBeans centered around a hash table data structure. The application allows users to instantiate either part-time or full-time employees. It includes functionality for adding employees, removing employees, searching employees within the system, changing employee information, and saving/loading files.
The application is handled through implementation in a GUI. To launch this project, run the "Main_jFrame.java" file. Terminal messages will be displayed that verify the "SYSTEM IS LIVE."
This project highlights the implementation of GUI functionality, hash table data structure, inheritance, and buffered reading/writing.
